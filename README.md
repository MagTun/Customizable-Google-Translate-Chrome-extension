I am trying to build a Chrome extension using these projects: https://github.com/matheuss/google-translate-api and https://github.com/cjvnjde/google-translate-api-browser.


# How to install the extension
- Download the zip of this project (tab Code) and unzip it
- In Chrome, go to this url chrome://extensions/ (or Chromium-based Edge : edge://extensions/)
- Enable "Developper mode"
- Drag and drop the unzipped folder on the extension tab. 
- To use it, click on the icon or add a shortcut to tigger the extension (from the extension tab, choose "Keyboard Shortcuts" 

# How the extension looks like:
(The options part is hidden by default, but is shown on this printscreen)
